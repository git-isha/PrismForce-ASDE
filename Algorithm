Ideology to proceed:
For each circle, check if Abhimanyu can battle or needs to use skips/recharges.
Update enemy powers if regeneration is needed.
Return "Success" if all circles are processed successfully, otherwise "Failure".
Algorithm
Initialise Variables:
User Input:
p: Initial power of Abhimanyu.
a: Total skips available.
b: Total recharge power Abhimanyu can do.
enemy_powers[]: Array of powers for 11 enemies.
Variables:
Abhimanyu's current power: current_power = p
Skips remaining: skips = a
Power recharge left: recharge_left = b
to store regenerated enemy powers for circles 3 and 7: regenerate_enemy[]
Regenerated Enemy Powers will be half of their initial power:
Set regenerate_enemy[2] to enemy_powers[2] / 2.      // For enemy 3
Set regenerate_enemy[6] to enemy_powers[6] / 2.     // For enemy 7


Loop from circle i from 0 to 10:
power = enemy_powers[i]
Check if Abhimanyu can battle:
If current_power >= power
current_power -= power
Regenerated Enemy to attack from behind in iterative next circle:
If i == 2 or i == 6     // circle 3 or 7
If i + 1 < 11
Set enemy_powers[i+1] to regenerate_enemy[i]
Else if current_power is less than power
Skip battle if skips are remaining:
If skips > 0:
skips = skips - 1
Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Else if recharge_left > 0:
recharge_left = recharge_left  - 1
Set current_power = p      // Initial power
Recheck Battle After Recharge // iterative part to check battle can create separate function while writing program to be invoked here.
If current_power >= power
current_power -= power
Regenerated Enemy:
If i == 2 or i == 6     // circle 3 or 7
If i + 1 < 11
Set enemy_powers[i+1] to regenerate_enemy[i]
Else (Recharge failed to meet enemy power):
Return "Failure"
Else (No skips or recharges left):
Return "Failure".


Return "Success"   // end of function

Test Cases
Test Case 1:
Initial power (p) = 30
Skips (a) = 0
Recharges available (b) = 2
enemy_powers = [25, 15, 25, 20, 10, 30, 18, 20, 9, 33, 12]
-> Failure: Abhimanyu cannot cross the Chakravyuha due to insufficient power and no skips or recharges left.
Test Case 2:
Initial power (p) = 50
Skips (a) = 6
Recharges available (b) = 2
enemy_powers = [25, 15, 25, 20, 10, 30, 18, 20, 9, 33, 12]
-> Success: Abhimanyu can cross the Chakravyuha.
